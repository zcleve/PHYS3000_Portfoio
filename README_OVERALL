Entry 001 - 01/30/2023
    Current and depressing work as of now for PR3. I slacked HARD the last week or so,
    but will be picking it up now. I completed the Charges txt file prompt and have included
    some notes in the readme in its directory. You can find all that I've completed for this
    report in this master branch. Current goal is all proficiencies for P1 attempted by prompts
    by thursday.
