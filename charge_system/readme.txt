        So far this prompt is 70% complete. I need to run by the numbers w/ Prof. but I hand calc.'d a few,
    so I believe they are right. After the numbers are check, I want to add visualization to this prompt. I
    plan on using matplotlib to plot the charges on an x-y grid, and represent the net forces as arrows on
    the same plot. To accomplish this I will need to create a new script to handle visualization, which I
    have already created and named. I will also need to modify the netForcesChargeSystem.py script to keep
    track of the r-hat vector of each electric force to derive an end direction of the net electric force
    on ea. charge. Further improvements from there would be optimization and an overhaul of the "physics
    engine" working here. Ideally, I would have a framework of code such that I need only add new equations
    of physics to. In other words, scripts that understand and handle common 'objects' in physics. I.e. force
    vectors, velocity vectors, acceleration vectors, etc. Blah blah blah, tbc

        As of today I think I've almost figured out version control? This prompt is complete
        minus the visualization component. This update is to consolidate the github and truly
        try to version control lol.
