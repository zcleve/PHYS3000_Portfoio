Easiest way I run main.py is by right-clicking on the charges.txt in pycharm and copying the direct path and pasting it into the path variable in main when I download from Github.

        So far this prompt is 70% complete. I need to run by the numbers w/ Prof. but I hand calc.'d a few,
    so I believe they are right. After the numbers are check, I want to add visualization to this prompt. I
    plan on using matplotlib to plot the charges on an x-y grid, and represent the net forces as arrows on
    the same plot. To accomplish this I will need to create a new script to handle visualization, which I
    have already created and named. I will also need to modify the netForcesChargeSystem.py script to keep
    track of the r-hat vector of each electric force to derive an end direction of the net electric force
    on ea. charge. Further improvements from there would be optimization and an overhaul of the "physics
    engine" working here. Ideally, I would have a framework of code such that I need only add new equations
    of physics to. In other words, scripts that understand and handle common 'objects' in physics. I.e. force
    vectors, velocity vectors, acceleration vectors, etc. Blah blah blah, tbc

        Over the course of today I've done alot. I believe I have figured out github, lmao. And I added part
    of the visualization component. I've also started writing code with an emphasis on re-usability. This can be seen
    in current progress in my fileStripper.py and vectorMath.py scripts. Eventually those will house more and more methods
    as I approach more and more prompts, and hopefully more script ideas arise too. I still need to replace the created methods
    in vectorMath in nFCS.py, as well as finish out some needed functions. I plan on having this prompt done-done and a new git
    repo started for my reusable scripts tomorrow.

            I have finished this prompt with the visualization component to the degree of satisfaction I had desired.
       Overall, I am unfortunately saddened by my lack of general progress towards any other coding, as I had simply just not done anything
       for like over a week. I plan on being much more proactive and generally productive in this class and in the prompts, portfolios, and projects.
       Time to become a Computational Physics Pro.
